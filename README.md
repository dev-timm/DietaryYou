# DietaryYou

Having different food problems can often make it hard to find inspiration and ideas for cooking new dishes. DietaryYou was built to support people with dietary needs by creating a community that supports each other through writing articles, sharing recipes and exchanging knowledge in the comments.

## Product Decisions 

### User Needs
As a user I want to...
- ...have a large offer of different recipes that fit my dietary plan so that I’m not bored of eating the same things over and over again.
- ...know what others say about their experience with different diets so that I can understand what works well and what doesn’t.
- ...share my experience and knowledge about diets so that I can help others to live a more healthy life. 
- ...see the most popular and recent articles so that I can easily find interesting topics to read.

### MVP
The MVP is a simple blog that aims to build a community of users with dietary issues so that people can support each other with tips and recipes. Therefore, the MVP provides users with the ability to create, read, edit and delete posts (CRUD). Moreover, users have the possibility to like and comment on posts which should welcome a healthy conversation to further discuss the topics mentioned in the post.

To create, edit and delete a post the user needs to register and be logged in. For the MVP they also have the ability to customize their public profiles by adding more information about themselves as well as adding a profile picture.
